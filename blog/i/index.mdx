Had my orientation today at CS, and it was a good reality check. Looking forward to the upcoming sessions.

The session commenced with a warm welcome from the CS team, instantly creating a sense of community.

Meeting my new peers was like a snapshot of the diversity that makes CS thrive. The brief interactions sparked a sense of camaraderie that bodes well for future collaborations.

My two-hour orientation at CS may have been short, but its impact was profound. It served as a snapshot of the vibrant community, the wealth of opportunities, and the collaborative spirit that defines CS. I'm now more than ready to embrace the challenges that await me in this dynamic and promising environment.

*Until next time,*
