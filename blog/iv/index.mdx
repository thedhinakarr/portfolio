**Introduction**

Binary numbers serve as the fundamental language that underpins the digital realm. While most people are familiar with the decimal system (base-10), understanding binary (base-2) is key to comprehending the inner workings of computers and digital systems. In this blog, we'll delve into the fascinating world of binary numbers, shedding light on their structure and exploring the concept of positive and negative binary representations.

**The Basics of Binary Numbers**

Binary, as the name suggests, is a numeral system based on two digits: 0 and 1. In contrast to the decimal system, which utilizes 10 digits (0-9), binary employs only two digits, making it a base-2 system. Every binary digit, or bit, represents a power of 2, starting from the rightmost bit, which represents 2^0, then 2^1, 2^2, and so on. For example, the binary number 1101 is equivalent to \( (1 \times 2^3) + (1 \times 2^2) + (0 \times 2^1) + (1 \times 2^0) \) in decimal, resulting in the value 13.

**Positive Binary Numbers**

Understanding positive binary numbers is relatively straightforward. The bits are used to represent powers of 2, and by summing these powers based on the positions of the 1s, we can derive the decimal equivalent. For instance, the binary number 101010 is equivalent to \( (1 \times 2^5) + (0 \times 2^4) + (1 \times 2^3) + (0 \times 2^2) + (1 \times 2^1) + (0 \times 2^0) \), resulting in the decimal value 42.

**Negative Binary Numbers**

Representing negative numbers in binary introduces the concept of two's complement, a method widely used in computer systems. Two's complement simplifies arithmetic operations and ensures that subtraction can be performed using the same logic as addition.

To obtain the two's complement of a binary number, follow these steps:
1. Invert all the bits (change 0s to 1s and vice versa).
2. Add 1 to the result.

For example, let's find the two's complement of the binary number 1011:
1. Invert the bits: 0100
2. Add 1: 0101

Therefore, the two's complement of 1011 is 10101, the leading bit indicing the sign( -1 -> -ve ) representing -5 in decimal.
