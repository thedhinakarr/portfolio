**The above illustration captures the gist of the session.**

Today's session was pretty intrguing. It was understanding the importance of a programmer or a software engineer to be aware about a computer's capabilities and threshold.


**50% of RAM should be free for smooth software development:**

Having 50% of your RAM available is essential for smooth software development. It ensures that your system has enough resources to handle the demands of coding and running applications without slowing down.

**The Solution for a faster system is not necessarily increasing the RAM:**

Contrary to popular belief, simply increasing your system's RAM may not always result in a faster system. Consider other factors like processor speed and storage type to achieve a well-balanced and optimized setup.

**FASTER RAM = FASTER DATA READING AND WRITING RATE:**

Investing in faster RAM can significantly improve your system's data reading and writing rates. This is particularly beneficial for tasks that involve handling large amounts of data, such as video editing or 3D rendering.

**BOOT SPEED IS DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE TYPE OF ROM THE SYSTEM CONTAINS:**

The type and size of the Read-Only Memory (ROM) in your system directly impact its boot speed. Choosing the right ROM can lead to quicker startup times, enhancing overall user experience. SSDs are superior.

**MOTHERBOARD CONNECTS ALL THESE COMPONENTS TOGETHER AND FACILITATES COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THEM USING DATA BUSES:**

The motherboard is the central hub that connects all your hardware components. Efficient communication between these components is facilitated by data buses on the motherboard, emphasizing its critical role in system performance.

**It is not always a NETWORK ISSUE:**

Performance issues are not always related to network connectivity. Sometimes, the bottleneck lies within the hardware components themselves. Ensure your system's internal components are optimized for the best overall performance.
Understanding aspects of computer networks like bandwidth, throughput, latency have a huge part in identifying lag issues within a system.

**BANDWIDTH:**

Bandwidth is a key factor in determining how much data your system can transfer. Higher bandwidth allows for quicker communication between components, reducing lag and improving overall system responsiveness.

**THROUGHPUT:**

Throughput, the actual amount of data transferred, is crucial for evaluating system performance. Optimizing throughput ensures that data moves efficiently within your system, minimizing delays and improving overall speed.

**Latency is proportional to the distance:**

Latency, or delay, is influenced by the physical distance data must travel. Minimizing latency is crucial for real-time applications, and understanding this relationship helps in optimizing your system for responsiveness.

The pace has begun to pick up. And I am all for it. Looking forward to the next session.

Until next time, **Dhinakarr**
