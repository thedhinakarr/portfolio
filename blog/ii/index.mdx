_If I have to summarize my understanding of the second day's session, the above code snippet would be it._

Navigating the Tech Seas:

As the second session dawned at CS, the excitement from the initial orientation was complemented by a more focused dive into the technical aspects of our journey. The session was dedicated to unraveling the intricacies of our technical landscape, providing us with a roadmap to navigate the upcoming challenges.

## Course Overview:

The session commenced with a comprehensive course overview, mapping out the terrain of our educational journey. From fundamental principles to advanced concepts, the curriculum promises a rich exploration of the engineering landscape.

## Understanding Engineering:

A key highlight was the exploration of the essence of engineering. We delved into the problem-solving mindset, the iterative nature of development, and the creative aspects that define engineering as both an art and a science.

## Decoding the Web:

The session unfolded with an insightful exploration of the web, unraveling the first web page ever to be hosted on the internet. And also came across what PWA(Progressive Web Application) is. 

## Software:
Instructions given to a computer to make it do what we intend to. (Is what I understood.)

(p.s: I know the text looks awful without splitting the paragraphs. But I am figuring out why the MDXRenderer in my application is not functioning properly. Searching for alternatives at the moment. Apologies)

Until next time, **Dhinakarr** :)
