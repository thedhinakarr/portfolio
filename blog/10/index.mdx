Hey guys, I know it's been long, but I was searching for some good topics to write blogs on. 

So this blog marks the beginning of a project I will be working on for a company in order to help speed up a certain a certain service of theirs.

I am going to build this project which is a scraping tool, using the very basic MERN stack. (MongoDb, Express, React, Node).

And will essentially record every step I take in this journey through these blog posts.

Until next time, **Dhinakarr**
